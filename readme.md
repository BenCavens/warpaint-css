# Warpaint

Think Tomorrow bootstrap stylesheet. 

**Note: this stylesheet should not be used in production yet as it is still under heavy construction towards a stable release**

## Warpaint follows these guidelines:
- never set font-size in the <html> to a pixel value because it overrides the user’s browser settings. Use em or rem instead
- it’s a best practice to use relative units like em for font-size.
- Size in em if the property scales according to it’s font-size
- Size everything else in rem.
- Increase font-size and line-height as screen sizes increase.
